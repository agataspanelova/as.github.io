    <h1>A poem </h1>
    <p>Whose stone is that?<br>
    I think I know.
Its owner is quite happy though.
Full of joy like a vivid rainbow,
I watch him laugh. I cry hello.

He gives his stone a shake,
And laughs until her belly aches.
The only other sound's the break,
Of distant waves and birds awake.
